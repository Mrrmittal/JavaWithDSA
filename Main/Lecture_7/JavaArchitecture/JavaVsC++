Que: Java Vs C++?
Sol: Java : Java is platform independent language. Because .java (source code) firstly convert into the byte code. that
            byte code can not run directly into the system. This byte needs JVM to compile and interpreter(Line by Line)
            to compile the code and convert into the machine code.

            So, In Java JVM help to make Java platform Independent language. But JVM is platform dependent.

      C++ : In Cpp compiler compile code directly into the machine code. So, there is no scope to generate byte code.
            that's does not help CPP to make platform independent language.

Que: What is Platform independent?
Sol: Platform independent mean byte code (Compile code) make more friendly with all operating system like Window , Linux
     Unix and all.
