Que: Why we use Programming Language?
Sol: As we know machine like computer only knows the binary language in form of O and 1. But its very difficult or
     might be impossible to us to build an application with using of 0 and 1. So in respect of human readable format
     we needs a programming language.

     Java is one of the most robust, Platform Independent programming language.

Que: what is the .java file?
Sol: All java file needs an extensions and this is the ".java" extensions. like any of other file extensions .txt, .pdf.
     So, for all kind of java code we need an file with extensions of .java.


Que: What is .class file?
Sol: After the compilation of .java file (Source code) compiler convert source code into the byte code. So, store to
     this byte code we .class file. that makes Java is an independent platform language. But this code can not run
     directly on the system. we need JVM here to compile this code to convert into the machine code (0 and 1).
